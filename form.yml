      - **any** - (*28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **vis** - (*28 cores*) This node includes an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU
        with an X server running in the background. This allows for Hardware
        Rendering with the GPU typically needed for 3D visualization using
        VirtualGL. There are currently only 160 of these nodes on Owens.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Oakley node that has 1.5TB of available
        RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 1 of these nodes on Owens.

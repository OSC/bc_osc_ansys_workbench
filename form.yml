      - **any** - (*28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **gpu** - (*28 cores*) Use an Owens node that has an NVIDIA P100 "Pascal" GPU with hardware rendering enabled for 3D visualization. There are 160 of these nodes on Owens.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Oakley node that has 1.5TB of available
        RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 1 of these nodes on Owens.
